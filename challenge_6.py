'''6 THE TERMINAL
The main maintenance terminal, last used in Monolith’s installation years ago.
Theoretically, this should allow you to bypass the automated maintenance and
facility isolation security principles, making it possible to connect to outside
networks. You are not the only one who wants access!
Bonus points
- Successfully deliver USB payload (insert device) +10p
- Have the high ground! (Win a match) +5p
There are 6 slots on the platform. If you arrive among the first, you may park your
robot in a vacant slot.
When the slots are full, or if you wish to do so before, you’ll need to challenge one
of the slot holders to a battle.
A robot that falls off the platform is defeated and will have to exit the TERMINAL.'''
